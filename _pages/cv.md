## Summary

The journey in Taiwan began when he met his current advisor through a sister school partnership between Tunku Abdul Rahman University in Malaysia and National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University. Before joining, he knew little about the research direction and wasn’t sure if it aligned with his interests or background. Starting from scratch felt like the perfect fit, as he transitioned from a focus on network technology to an entirely new research field.

Choosing Jiaotong University for his master's was a spontaneous decision, with little understanding of its academic rigor. Over time, he found the environment more challenging and engaging than expected, pushing him to explore new areas like web scraping, linux, operating systems, IoT, and large language models.

In his free time, he enjoys reading materials outside his field, which has broadened his knowledge and perspective. The journey from zero to one has been challenging yet full of possibilities.

  * Thesis Topic:  A Framework of Reproducible MITRE Lifecycle Extraction and Mapping with Enhanced-LLM
    * This thesis develops a system called DEAP-LLM to automate the extraction and mapping of MITRE attack lifecycles from CTF write-ups. It addresses challenges such as dataset imbalance and the difficulty of extracting detailed techniques. The framework trains a language model to map attack approaches to lifecycle stages. Despite limitations due to the language model's capabilities, the system effectively enriches the dataset and improves the process of lifecycle extraction and mapping when data is insufficient.
